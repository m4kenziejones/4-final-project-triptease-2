## Team Values & Team Norms

### Team Values
- **Collaboration**: We prioritize open communication and the sharing of ideas to achieve the best possible outcomes.
- **Communication**: We will communicate when we're working on a feature or if we encounter any blockers.
- **Respect**: Every team member's ideas and contributions are valued and considered with respect.
- **Accountability**: Each team member is responsible for their own tasks and deadlines. We hold ourselves and each other accountable.
- **Continuous Improvement**: We strive to learn from each sprint and continuously improve our processes and product.
- **Transparency**: We maintain clear and honest communication about our progress, challenges, and individual workloads.
- **Documentation**: We will document our code properly to ensure it's understandable for other contributors.


### Team Norms
- **Daily Standup and Sprint Meeting**: Meetings are held every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday at 5 PM.
- **Role Rotation**: At the start of each sprint, the roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner rotate among team members to ensure balanced contributions.
    - **Scrum Master**: Leads daily standups, manages the progress of the project, and updates the task board.
    - **Product Owner**: Prioritizes and oversees tasks, prepares the Stakeholder Demo, and communicates the vision of the product.
    - **Developers**: Focus on building features, completing tasks, and preparing a functional product for demos.

- **Task Management**: Each team member updates the Sprint Task Board to communicate the current status of tasks. Meeting notes are documented for each standup to track workloads and task prioritization.
- **Commit Confirmation**: Before committing any changes, team members should consult with others to ensure the functionality is intact, minimize merge conflicts, and maintain code quality.

## Git Workflow
Our Git workflow follows these steps to maintain a structured and organized development process:

1. **Branching Strategy**: 
   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/login-page` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`).
   - All work is done in feature branches, which are based on the `main` or `develop` branch.

2. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made (e.g., `Add login functionality` or `Fix issue with session timeout`).
   - Commits should be frequent and modular to make it easier to track changes.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - Before creating a PR, ensure your branch is up to date with the `develop` branch.
   - Submit a pull request when the feature is complete, and assign it to the Product Owner or a designated reviewer for approval.
   - Discuss any comments or changes required in the PR and make necessary adjustments.

4. **Merging Strategy**:
   - Only merge a branch into `develop` after it has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
   - Avoid direct commits to the `main` or `develop` branches; only merge using pull requests.

5. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - In case of merge conflicts, resolve them locally before pushing the changes.
   - Communicate with the team if conflicts are complex or affect multiple areas of the code.
